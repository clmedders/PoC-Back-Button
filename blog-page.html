      Take a deep breath and Imagine yourself in a world where you wake up at 7:30am and have to be at work by 8:00am but the sad part is that you live in Nigeria's commercial hub and traffic is now your extra- curricular activity. However, In this world, your pseudo suit has been neatly ironed and waiting to be worn. There's breakfast in bed too(and if you want, there's someone you can call on to feed you.) The best part? there's an automobile that encodes your destination and  teleports you to work. The impact is that you get to work before Ms Helen who woke up at 4:00am and had to fix hotdogs for breakfast; the same you woke up to meet smoky, hot and greasy. While she had to sieve her way through traffic and almost had a fight with the danfo driver, you were still on your bed, dreaming about your crush and smiling sheepishly. What's worse? Your Boss tells everyone about how they should be like you. He tells them that with people like Helen, the company will come to dust but with hardworking and punctual people like you, the company is set for great things. You are happy and suddenly feel like how a teenager feels when the Principal fixes the senior prefect badge on the breast pocket of his crispy ironed packet white. Helen on the other hand, walks into the office stealthily like a child hiding from the wrath of her father. But you are not really the best. You are not really a punctual person either. However,  the deal is, you have accessibility to quality and handy services.


          



Wake yourself a bit from that little imagination. Let's pitch another scenario. A more practical and recent one. One day, everything was okay. The world was moving smoothly as planned. You were ready to achieve your SDG this 2020. You told yourself too that you had to make the best out of this year beginning a new Decade. But soon, everything really begins to "flip the switch," and the next day, there's a new world power shaking all world powers. It's making the headlines on Newspapers, and newscasters on TV stylishly pronounce it "KONVID-Nintin." It is trending as number one Twitter. But that's the sweet side to it. The flip side? The world had no clue that sometime in 2020, a viral infection would uncontrollably reduce population, drain the economy and now  almost every country is faced with the threat of plunging into recession. They had no clue that someday even with their  healthcare workers, robots and scientists, their fatalities would make the top stories. It's worse in Nigeria because there are demons to fight in every angle. Limited Personnel. Almost no standard equipment. Mismanaged resources, confused leaders and painfully, ignorance. Now, the country is running helter skelter. But what if every country already had an app where it could get any vaccine of any kind? What if Nigeria had an app where citizens could easily access quality  health care services from the comfort of their homes  without necessarily having to contest the already limited centers? This is what having Access to having handy services does to you. There is synergy between quality, timeliness and cost. 





Look around you and see how the world smells of handy services. Once Upon a time, the only thing we knew about education was getting to class, buying all the textbooks,  doing assignments, examinations and boom, you are educated. Today, all that is cliche. There is access to unlimited E books which is cost effective and can be easily gotten rather than the days where you had to go from bookshop to bookshop in search of one book you may never find. There is also Unlimited access to online courses which are not so time stringent and which takes shorter time to complete. Most times, you need them to understand the traditional "going to class" education system. 

Sometime ago, Nigerian banking sector could not boast of wide acceptance of use of Automated Teller Machine For Various Transactions. If you needed to withdraw as low as #2000, you had to endure the almost never moving queue and most times and had limited time from 8-4 to access this service. Fast forward to years later and from your comfort zone, almost any transaction can be done without time restrictions and now we have even moved from ATMs to online transactions.









Let's leave the banking sector and move on to transportation. Once upon a time,  the only way you could access cab services was to also "trek" to the park, engage in unhealthy negotiation with the driver that would almost lead to little quarrels and most times, you had to deal with trust issues because most of these cars were operational tools for the popular "One Chance" guys. Low quality cars were in vogue as cab and it was the only way we knew.  Today the narrative has changed. Transportation has revamped from the cliche we knew. From anywhere you are, in split seconds, there's this AC tight Camry 2.4 with a handsome mister as the driver that gets you blushing through the ride. There's no price tussle and you get to your destination like royalty. What changed? Accessibility to handy service.

The movie industry witnessed this revamp too. We had the era when a rectangular shaped disc, which we called video cassettes or home videos were the only means of getting access to our movies. Then we witnessed an advanced era of DVDs. But the thing is, they revolved around the same idea. You still had to walk to those rental stores decorated with posters of recent movies. You needed cash in real time to either purchase or rent some. Fast forward to 2020 and while on your bed, there are websites that are cost effective and fast in granting you easy access to these movies and it's stored on your phone or laptop for as long as you want. 

Interestingly, the world has moved to the era of smart work over hard work and all that's left is for you to make use of the services smiling at you daily. There's a woman in my neighborhood I admire so much. While building my life plan, I had written her name as a role model. This was because of how productive she was in her work. Talk about balancing career and family care. What I didn't know till I got closer to her was that she was one of those who had taken advantage of handy services made available in our today's world. Most of her services were run by artisans from Jornyman Mobile App and it's so exciting seeing how the world is becoming  more quality service friendly each day with the use of a service app like Jornyman. 

A jornyman is a person with the competence and skills to perform a specific job and using Jornyman is a simple way to save time and money while enjoying quality services. Imagine having a wedding to attend and in dire need of a makeup artist. You are confused because Instagram seems to be experiencing the dawn of new make up artists daily. You are confused on which to pick because you can't really tell which is good and you don't want to be a protagonist in the  "What you ordered versus what you got" episode. While you are at this, there is passage of time and chances are that the options available are not pocket friendly. This is where Jornyman comes in. Jornyman is robust with artisans in various industries and  with just a login, you get the quality service you yearn for. With your fingertips, Jornyman brings quality service to your doorstep ranging from household, automobile,lifestyle, events, construction, ICT and many more. Away from the cost effectiveness, timeliness and quality service, Jornyman guarantees you the peace of mind you need when hiring someone for the Job.  It helps you skip all technicalities you need to put in place to ensure you hire the best person for the job because it does that for you.
